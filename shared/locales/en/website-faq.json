			{
				"question": "Is it helpful to send money to people in need?",
				"answer": "It’s definitely more helpful than sending no money at all. Many people today advocate for equal opportunity in employment. This is obviously a goal worth aiming for, but it tends to ignore the fact that for many people born in the world’s poorest countries, employment as it is typically understood isn’t even possible or accessible. Giving money can help break down this barrier and give more people living in poverty access to work, education, and decent living conditions.",

		"title": "Striving for equality",
		"questions": [
			{
				"question": "Can Social Income create equality?",
				"answer": "Social Income isn’t a theory of equality. It’s here to help make the world more fair, by taking advantage of the immense gap between rich and poor to carry out a simple, direct redistribution based on solidarity. It also helps contribute to self-driven change and a certain degree of financial independence for people in need. This process only works as long as inequality continues to exist; as soon as the distribution of wealth across the world becomes balanced, Social Income will no longer be useful."
			},
			{
				"question": "Who can eliminate inequality?",
				"answer": "States or markets can, in theory. But not all states (can) care for their citizens adequately and not all markets create long-lasting equality for everyone. That’s where a third option comes in: ourselves. We already know how to recognize inequality and feel empathy for disadvantaged people, even if they aren’t exactly our neighbors. And we also have the technical skills to move money globally. If you think about it, nothing is missing to start remedying the world’s economic grievances today."

	"solidarity": {
		"title": "Solidarity",
		"questions": [
			{
				"question": "Do we have responsibilities toward our fellow human beings?",
				"answer": "We believe so, yes. In a globalized world with almost no borders for goods and outsourced production, all histories become interconnected in shared destinies."
			},
			{
				"question": "Can solidarity survive in the age of individualization?",
				"answer": "Today, solidarity is an endangered resource. In an era that emphasizes the individual over everything else, our sense of community often takes a backseat to personal success. But this doesn’t mean that solidarity will disappear; it just has to adapt, and so do the projects that rely on it to meet their goals. From this perspective, we believe that solidarity can be stronger than ever. Individualization also means that everyone who wants to get involved in solidarity can do so, without any roadblocks to stop them. The only difference is that they’ll do it on their own terms, with their own methods. Social Income is one choice available among others. A new kind. The major issues that humanity faces, whether economic or ecological, are too complex and interlinked to be solved without recourse to solidarity. Individualism may be a fine road to personal self-discovery, but it isn’t of much use in solving collective challenges like inequality and poverty."

	"ubi": {
		"title": "Universal Basic Income",
		"questions": [
			{
				"question": "What is the difference between Social Income and Universal Basic Income?",
				"answer": "Like Universal Basic Income (UBI), Social Income provides regular, unconditional payments as a basic living stipend delivered to citizens on an individual basis. Whereas Universal Basic Income would be provided by a state or government, Social Income is provided from person to person. This means that it doesn’t have to rely on political will, budgeting, or taxation to succeed. Social Income is also specifically aimed at people living in extreme poverty, so its primary goal is wealth redistribution—which isn’t necessarily the case of UBI."
			},
			{
				"question": "What are Direct Cash Transfers?",
				"answer": "According to the official OECD’s definition, cash transfers “consist of the payment of currency or transferable deposit by one unit to another without any counterpart”. More concretely, direct cash transfers are a form of social protection that includes cash or vouchers given directly to poor individuals rather than to governments or other state actors. Particularly over the past decade, they have been increasingly used as a tool for reducing poverty and vulnerability in middle and low-income countries.",

	"contributors": {
		"title": "Contributors",
		"questions": [
			{
				"question": "Why 1% of contributors’ salaries?",
				"answer": "For Social Income to be scalable, we need to be sure it works. To ensure it works, we need to start small. This means using both a small pool of initial recipients and asking for a small initial donation from contributors. 1% is a negligible amount for contributors that can have a considerable impact on recipients’ lives, though higher donations may be possible in the future. For example, say 25% of Swiss citizens support Social Income with 1% of their income. Given that the average salary in Switzerland is $6,000 per month, this would pay for Social Income for every person living in Sierra Leone. This very simplified illustration can still give us a good idea of the project’s potential."

			},
			{
				"question": "What do recipients need the money for?",
				"answer": "The very idea behind UBI is to give recipients money that they can use as they please."
			},
			{
				"question": "How can I receive Social Income?",
				"answer": "We work closely with local advocates to determine future recipients. There is currently no option to sign up through our website."
			},
			{
				"question": "Why Sierra Leone?",
				"answer": "You have to start somewhere, and Sierra Leone makes sense for several reasons. While one of the world’s younger democracies, it unfortunately regularly tops rankings as one of its poorest countries. Still, big progress has been made in recent years, notably in adopting mobile banking in urban areas across the country. So, not only is Sierra Leone in need of help, it’s also uniquely positioned to receive it from a digitally-focused approach. That said, Social Income isn’t just made for Africa. We believe that individual action can have a universal impact and hope to expand the project’s reach to people in need across the world. In the future, the initiative could also be rolled out to countries in Latin America and Asia, for example. However, to focus our energy as best as possible, it makes sense to gain experience in a single location first."

				"question": "What is Social Income's link to the arts?",

	"selection": {
		"title": "Recipient Selection",
		"questions": [
			{
				"question": "Why do we select randomly out of a pool of qualified recipients?",
				"answer": "The purpose of employing this random selection method is to achieve several objectives. Firstly, it helps prevent bias in our recipient selection, ensuring that relatives or acquaintances of individuals involved in the process are not given preferential treatment. Secondly, it aims to avoid tensions between recipients and non-recipients, as well as any potential conflicts between recipients and our organization. Lastly, we strive to incorporate technology where it is feasible and beneficial to the process."
			},
			{
				"question": "Who can influence the draft?",
				"answer": "By relying on an unpredictable random value from drand, set to be emitted in the future, it's not possible for anyone to sway the results of the selection process. This inherent randomness can be utilized to confirm the integrity of the selection. To qualify for Social Income, an individual must first be on a list provided by an NGO. While this does present a preliminary condition, it aligns with our foundational principle: ensuring that Social Income reaches those most in need."
			},
			{
				"question": "How do we avoid bias and tensions?",
				"answer": "To ensure we don't inadvertently prioritize a specific ethnic group, gender, or occupation, we collaborate with diverse NGOs that have varied missions. In line with our 'do no harm' policy, we strive to prevent tensions among recipients, non-recipients, communities, and the NGOs. Our random selection plays a pivotal role in achieving this. It ensures that those related to or acquainted with individuals in the process aren't shown favoritism, which could lead to conflicts."
			},
			{
				"question": "What is happening during the selection process?",
				"answer": "We utilize the random number provided by drand, which is publicly accessible, to pick a set number of individuals from our list. Here's how it's done: we first organize the hashed list of recipients. Then, using the randomness element from drand, we convert it into a position on the list through a key derivation function. For those keen on the technical details, the function and its associated processes are documented in our open source repository.",

				"question": "What is drand and who is behind it?",
				"answer": "The drand project generates random numbers that everyone can trust. It can be applied to create truly random and verifiable drafts. Initiated in 2017 at EPFL by Nicolas Gailly, drand received support from Philipp Jovanovic and was guided by Bryan Ford. It has since become independently managed and maintains a network called the League of Entropy with EPFL, UCL, Cloudflare, Kudelski Security, the University of Chile, and Protocol Labs. Current core maintainers of the open source project are Erick Watson, Yolan Romailler and Patrick McClurg from Randamu.",

				"question": "What is the amount disbursed to the recipients?",
				"answer": "Recipients of Social Income receive a monthly payment of USD 32, which is converted into their local currency and directly deposited to their mobile phones. This sum is carefully chosen to help secure the basic needs of a person living in poverty, considering that the national average income is around USD 42 (World Bank). These payments are reliably made every month over a span of three years. This sustained, long-term support strategy is intended to empower individuals in poverty, enabling them to plan and invest for the future, particularly in aspects like health, thereby enhancing their financial stability and overall well-being."

		"title": "Frequently asked questions",

			{
				"question": "Who is collaborating to make this fundraiser possible?",
				"answer": "This fundraiser is under the patronage of Ismatu Gwendolyn Bangura, an author and activist from Sierra Leone. It is hosted by the Swiss non-profit organization Social Income, which is also responsible for distributing the basic incomes to Ebola survivors over the next three years. Social Income has extensive experience in mobile payouts to people living in poverty in Sierra Leone. Additionally, we collaborate with the Sierra Leone Association of Ebola Survivors based in Kenema, who maintains close contact with each of the survivors."
			},
			{
				"question": "How do the funds reach the Ebola survivors?",
				"answer": "The funds are transferred directly to the Ebola survivors through mobile banking technology. This method ensures a swift and secure delivery of the funds, allowing the survivors to receive their aid promptly and efficiently. The use of mobile banking also helps maintain transparency and reduces the risk of mismanagement, ensuring that the funds are used effectively to support the survivors' needs."

			},
			{
				"question": "What are the uses of the funds I donate?",
				"answer": "Your donations, up to the fundraising goal, are dedicated to supporting Ebola survivors. This includes the monthly payouts to each survivor including delivery fees and associated costs. Any donations exceeding the fundraising goal will be utilized to support other vulnerable individuals and people living in poverty in Sierra Leone."
			},
			{
				"question": "How are recipients chosen?",
				"answer": "Should the fundraising goal be met, all 156 Ebola survivors registered by the Sierra Leone Association of Ebola Survivors in Kenema will be selected as recipients. In this scenario, no further selection is required. However, if the fundraising target isn't achieved, we will conduct a random selection from the candidates. This approach serves two key purposes: Firstly, it helps ensure impartiality in choosing recipients, preventing favoritism towards relatives or acquaintances of those involved in the process. Secondly, it aims to minimize any potential conflicts or tensions, both between those who receive aid and those who don't, and between recipients and the organizations involved."
