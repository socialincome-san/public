    "lead": "The Do No Harm (DNH) approach is a framework that helps minimize unintended negative consequences of aid programs. It identifies risks and reduces potential harm by carefully reviewing all parts of a project, including recipient selection, distribution methods, and the overall impact of assistance. Social Income applies these principles systematically and shares its approach transparently to show how risks are addressed and how the program remains safe, fair, and beneficial for recipients and their communities.",
