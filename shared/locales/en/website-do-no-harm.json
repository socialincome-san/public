  "lead": "The Do No Harm (DNH) approach is a framework designed to minimize the unintended negative consequences of aid programs. By critically reflecting on every aspect of a project, it helps identify risks and mitigate harm, especially when aid is delivered in the form of unconditional cash transfers. Social Income seeks to carefully assess various aspects of the aid process, including recipient selection, distribution methods, and the potential impact of the assistance in order to minimize the risk of misuse and harm.
