		"title": "Frequently asked questions",
		"questions": [
			{
				"question": "Who is collaborating to make this fundraiser possible?",
				"answer": "This fundraiser is under the patronage of Ismatu Bangura, an activist from Sierra Leone. It is hosted by the Swiss non-profit organization Social Income, which is also responsible for distributing the basic incomes to Ebola survivors over the next three years. Social Income has extensive experience in mobile payouts to people living in poverty in Sierra Leone. Additionally, we collaborate with the Sierra Leone Association of Ebola Survivors based in Kenema, who maintains close contact with each of the survivors."
			},
			{
				"question": "How does the funds reach the Ebola survivors?",
				"answer": "The funds are transferred directly to the Ebola survivors through mobile banking technology. This method ensures a swift and secure delivery of the funds, allowing the survivors to receive their aid promptly and efficiently. The use of mobile banking also helps maintain transparency and reduces the risk of mismanagement, ensuring that the funds are used effectively to support the survivors' needs."
			},
			{
				"question": "What is the amount disbursed to the recipients?",
				"answer": "Recipients of Social Income receive a monthly payment of USD 32, which is converted into their local currency and directly deposited to their mobile phones. This sum is carefully chosen to help secure the basic needs of a person living in poverty, considering that the national average income is around USD 42 (World Bank). These payments are reliably made every month over a span of three years. This sustained, long-term support strategy is intended to empower individuals in poverty, enabling them to plan and invest for the future, particularly in aspects like health, thereby enhancing their financial stability and overall well-being."
			},
			{
				"question": "What are the uses of the funds I donate?",
				"answer": "Your donations, up to the fundraising goal, are dedicated to supporting Ebola survivors. This includes the monthly payouts of USD 32 to each survivor and covering delivery fees such as foreign exchange fees and transaction costs. Any donations exceeding the fundraising goal will be utilized to support other vulnerable individuals and people living in poverty in Sierra Leone."
			},
			{
				"question": "How are recipients chosen?",
				"answer": "Should the fundraising goal be met, all 154 Ebola survivors registered by the Sierra Leone Association of Ebola Survivors in Kenema will be selected as recipients. In this scenario, no further selection is required. However, if the fundraising target isn't achieved, we will conduct a random selection from these 154 candidates. This approach serves two key purposes: Firstly, it helps ensure impartiality in choosing recipients, preventing favoritism towards relatives or acquaintances of those involved in the process. Secondly, it aims to minimize any potential conflicts or tensions, both between those who receive aid and those who don't, and between recipients and the organizations involved."
