# How to test the app for the release?

Usually for a upcoming release we test the app manually to ensure that
the core functionality is still working.

For that we use usually the environment STAGING.

- Here you find a description of the available
  [test environments](./test_environments.md), its usage and how to
  access them.

- Here you find the prepared
  [test accounts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-y__kbnLX3KCHp2pdXhzq58rbMmnXwUI-Cirihy224o/edit?pli=1#heading=h.4a9qjbxltxku)
  to use for tesing the app. **These test accounts are only accessable
  for core developers**. Please try to leave these accounts in the
  described account state after your tests. This makes testing for all
  of us easier :).

- Here you find the
  [manual test plans](../app_testing_guides/manual_test_plans.md).
