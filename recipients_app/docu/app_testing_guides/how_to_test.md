# How to test the app for the release?

Usually for a upcoming release we test the app manually to ensure that the core functionality is still working.

For that we use usually the environment STAGING.

- Here you find a description of the available [test environments](./test_environments.md), its usage and how to access them.

- Here you find the prepared [test accounts](./test_accounts.md) to use for tesing the app. Please try to leave these accounts in the described account state after your tests. This makes testing for all of us easier :).

- Here you find the [manual test plans](../app_testing_guides/manual_test_plans.md).
