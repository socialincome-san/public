# Functions

The backend of Social Income which takes care of the data management. It
consists of scheduled jos, firestore triggers and webhooks deployed to
firebase functions.

## Basic Setup

For the basic setup, please refer to the main [README](../README.md)

## Run tests

Run the following command to start the emulators and run the unit tests

```shell
npm run functions:test
```

### End-to-End Tests

We use playwright to test against unwanted regressions on several
browsers. The playwright tests are located in `tests/playwright`.

The test is executed as part of `functions` GitHub Action when creating
a PR. A link to the hosted report is automatically posted.

To update the baseline snapshots post a comment with
`/update-functions-snapshots` to the PR. This will trigger the
`functions-update-snapshots` action which will commit the new pngs.

## Start Functions Locally

To serve https endpoints (e.g. webhooks) locally run

```shell
npm run firebase:serve
npm run functions:serve
```

## Deployment

When a PR is merged into the `main` branch, the code is automatically
deployed to the staging environment. See the
[Github Actions](../.github/workflows) for more details.
