# Social Income - Survey Tool

## Development

### Quick start

**Always run the commands from the root of the mono-repository**, as
there are dependencies to other projects in the workspace:

```sh
# Development. Starts the survey dev server at localhost:6007 and the ui documentation at localhost:6006
$ make survey-serve

# Production build
$ make survey-build
```
