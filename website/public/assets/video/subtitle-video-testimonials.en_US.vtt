00:00:04.975 --> 00:00:07.635
Anyone who has grown up in poverty knows what it takes

1
00:00:07.635 --> 00:00:08.915
to break free from hardship.

2
00:00:10.895 --> 00:00:12.435
But without the money to realize it,

3
00:00:12.665 --> 00:00:15.075
even the clearest vision remains trapped in the dark.

4
00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:17.915
Thatâ€™s where Social Income comes in.

5
00:00:21.575 --> 00:00:23.915
We make mobile money transfers to those in need,

6
00:00:24.145 --> 00:00:26.635
providing recipients with funds to invest in ideas,

7
00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:28.995
learning, and community building.

8
00:00:35.945 --> 00:00:39.125
Social Income allows me to think

9
00:00:39.135 --> 00:00:40.500
on how to spend the money

10
00:00:40.525 --> 00:00:42.165
on my own terms.

11
00:00:44.475 --> 00:00:46.685
As soon as it arrives, I use it

12
00:00:46.785 --> 00:00:48.965
to buy internet for my phone.

13
00:00:49.105 --> 00:00:50.245
The internet is important

14
00:00:50.315 --> 00:00:53.845
because it allows me to contact my clients

15
00:00:54.385 --> 00:00:56.565
and research for my school.

16
00:01:00.035 --> 00:01:02.805
Your donation empowers those with fewer opportunities

17
00:01:02.905 --> 00:01:05.485
to build a better, more prosperous future for themselves.

18
00:01:05.505 --> 00:01:09.000
I believe that learning any type of skill

19
00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:13.000
can help you to reduce poverty.

20
00:01:15.925 --> 00:01:17.885
I want to be an IT expert

21
00:01:18.185 --> 00:01:20.925
and make my life a meaningful one to me.

22
00:01:21.405 --> 00:01:23.485
I have no doubt that it will help me to not go out again,

23
00:01:23.495 --> 00:01:24.685
because I was a street beggar.

24
00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:26.405
Social Income is real change

25
00:01:26.415 --> 00:01:28.485
created from human to human,

26
00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:29.485
phone to phone.

27
00:01:29.945 --> 00:01:31.940
You came into our lives

28
00:01:31.945 --> 00:01:32.965
when we needed you most.
