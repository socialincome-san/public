# Contributing Code to Social Income

### We maintain different contributing guidelines for each part of our tech stack:
- Admin Tool
- Functions
- Recipients App
- [User Interface (UI)](https://github.com/socialincome-san/public/blob/main/ui/CONTRIBUTION.md)

**Reason:** One single contributing guideline would be rather long, cluttered and not useful.
