## Social Income is a radically simple solution in the fight against poverty. The global open-source initiative converts donations into an unconditional basic income, which is sent directly to the mobile phones of people living in poverty in the Global South.

**Frontend developers:** You can also develop UI components with
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and
[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) independent of the website
([Readme](ui/README.md) / [Contributing](ui/CONTRIBUTING.md)). The
components are all collected in our
[Storybook](https://socialincome-san.github.io/public/).

### Basic Development Setup

We are mainly leveraging the following tools:

- [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) for data
  management
- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) for
  user management
- [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting) to serve
  static content, such as the admin app
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for website hosting
- [Firebase Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions) to
  run backend code in a serverless framework
- [Firebase Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage) to store
  documents and other files
- [Firebase Emulators](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite)
  for the local dev environment

#### 1. Prerequisites

**Node.js:** `brew install node@18` (Homebrew). Make sure you are using
Node.js 18. Follow
[this](https://ralphjsmit.com/switch-between-nodejs-versions-homebrew)
guide to switch between different versions of Node.js if need be.

**java**: `brew install openjdk` (Homebrew). See also troubleshooting
below.

<details>
  <summary>Troubleshooting</summary>

#### Error Missing Java

````shell
➜  socialincome-public git:(main) npm run firebase:serve

> @socialincome/monorepo@1.0.0 firebase:serve
> firebase emulators:start --project social-income-staging --config firebase.json --import ./seed

⚠  emulators: You are not currently authenticated so some features may not work correctly. Please run firebase login to authenticate the CLI.
i  emulators: Shutting down emulators.

Error: Process `java -version` has exited with code 1. Please make sure Java is installed and on your system PATH.
-----Original stdout-----
-----Original stderr-----
The operation couldn’t be completed. Unable to locate a Java Runtime.
Please visit http://www.java.com for information on installing Java.```
````

Solution

```shell
$ brew install openjdk
$ sudo ln -sfn $HOMEBREW_PREFIX/opt/openjdk/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk.jdk
```

</details>

#### 2. Install the dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

#### 3. Start environment

Initiate development environments for specific tools as needed (see
[table above](#oss-tools-by-social-income)).

- Always start the Firebase emulator first with `npm run firebase:serve`
  — console dashboard is available at
  [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
- To start the Admin Tool, run `npm run admin:serve` and open
  [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- To start the Website, run `npm run website:serve` and open
  [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).
- To start the Storybook, run `npm run ui:serve` and open
  [localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006). (currently broken)

The [package.json](package.json) file gives you a good overview of the
available commands.

<details>
  <summary>Troubleshooting</summary>

#### Port taken

```shell
Error: Could not start Firestore Emulator, port taken.
```

Solution (macOS): In most cases it is due to port 8080 or 8085, which
can be _killed_ with one command:

```shell
kill $(lsof -t -i:8080) $(lsof -t -i:8085)
```

### Developing

#### Developer Logins

No production credentials are needed for local development.

<details>
  <summary>Developer Login for Admin Tool</summary>

#### Localhost Admin Tool Login ([Link](http://localhost:3000/))

Choose "Sign in with Google" and select the listed "Admin
(admin@socialincome.org)" account.

#### Staging Admin Tool Login ([Link](https://staging-admin.socialincome.org))

Contact the dev team
([dev@socialincome.org](mailto:dev@socialincome.org)) which can assign
you access rights to login.

#### Production Admin Tool Login ([Link](http://admin.socialincome.org))

Only selected people from the SI team have access.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Developer Login for Website (Donor Dashboard)</summary>

#### Localhost Website Login ([Link](http://localhost:3000/login))

1. Go to the [Login page](http://localhost:3000/login) and select
2. Sign in with username test@test.org and password test@test.org.

#### Staging Website Login ([Link](https://staging.socialincome.org/login))

To create a donor account in the staging environment, proceed through
the
[donation process](https://staging.socialincome.org/donate/one-time).
Utilize the [Stripe test card](https://stripe.com/docs/testing) (4242
4242 4242 4242) for making a test donation.

#### Production Website Login ([Link](https://socialincome.org/login))

Only actual donors have accounts and can log in. Consider making a
(symbolic) donation to create your own account.

</details>

#### Data Seed

An initial dataset is imported into the Firebase emulators at startup.
You have the flexibility to add, delete, or modify data directly through
your [Admin Tool](http://localhost:3000) or the
[Firestore Admin Interface](http://localhost:4000/firestore/data)
locally. After making any changes, you can export the updated data to
the seed folder using the command `npm run firebase:export`.

#### Format Code

We are using [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to format the code:
`npm run format-code`.

#### Deployments

**Staging:** PRs merged into `main` are automatically deployed to
staging ([Admin Tool](https://staging-admin.socialincome.org) /
[Website](https://staging.socialincome.org/)) upon core developer
approval. Check [Github Actions](./.github/workflows) for details.
Experienced contributors can deploy directly
[without approval](mailto:dev@socialincome.org).

**Production:** Deployments are made by core developers via
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/socialincome-san/public/actions/workflows/production-deployment.yml).

<details>
<summary>Naming Convention</summary>

Use the format "release-YYYY-MM-DD" for naming releases (example:
`release-2021-02-27`). For multiple releases on the same day, append a
suffix such as ".2", ".3", and so forth, to distinguish them (example:
`release-2021-02-27.2`).

</details>

#### Backups

We have a
[function](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/query;query=resource.type%3D%22cloud_function%22%20resource.labels.function_name%3D%22siWebFirestoreExport%22%20resource.labels.region%3D%22us-central1%22?project=social-income-prod&authuser=1&hl=en)
which triggers hourly backups of our production firestore database. The
exports are saved to the
[social-income-prod](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/social-income-prod;tab=objects?forceOnBucketsSortingFiltering=false&authuser=1&project=social-income-prod&prefix=&forceOnObjectsSortingFiltering=true)
bucket with a retention period of 30 days.

<details>
<summary>Restore Database</summary>

To restore the database you can
[import](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/import-export?authuser=1&project=social-income-prod)
the most recent folder directly from the
[social-income-prod](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/social-income-prod;tab=objects?forceOnBucketsSortingFiltering=false&authuser=1&project=social-income-prod&prefix=&forceOnObjectsSortingFiltering=true)
bucket.
