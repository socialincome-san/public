## Social Income is a radically simple solution in the fight against poverty. We turn 1% of anyone's salary into an unconditional basic income for people living in poverty ‚Äì sent directly to their mobile phones. The tools that make this possible are built and continuously improved upon by an open source community, who use their technical skills to take on the [SDG 1](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal1) (No Poverty) and the [SDG 10](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal10) (Reduced Inequality).

### Development Setup

```
Visit the `Readme` and `Contributing` files in the submodules for detailed instructions
```

We are using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) as development
platform. We are mainly leveraging the following tools:
[Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) for data
management,
[Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) for
user management,
[Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting) to serve
static content like the admin app,
[Firebase Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions) to run
backend code in a serverless framework and
[Firebase Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage) to store
documents and other files.

For development we use [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and rely on
local
[Firebase Emulators](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite),
which are populated with dummy seed data. Ensures that no one will
require production Firebase credentials to contribute. To avoid any
operating system specific installation, we use a
[helper docker image](Dockerfile) and
[docker-compose](docker-compose.yaml) file to run the npm commands and
to start the emulators.

Build helper image locally run:

```
docker compose build
```

The [Makefile](Makefile) gives you a good overview of the available
commands. E.g. you can start the firebase emulators on
[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with

```
make firebase-serve
```

### Data Seed

An initial set of data is imported into the Firebase emulators during
startup. You can add, delete or amend data directly in your local
[Social Income Admin](http://localhost:3000) or in your local
[Firestore Admin Interface](http://localhost:4000/firestore/data). Start
the firestore emulator and our admin with:

```
make admin-serve
```

If you want to commit (no sensitive data) or keep a local copy of your
altered data set, you can execute in a second shell (while the command
above still is running) the command

```
 make firebase-export
```

### Format Code

We are using [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to format the code

```shell
make format-code
```

### Deployment

Testing and deployment of the services is handled automatically through
the [GitHub actions](.github/workflows).

### Backup

We have a
[function](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/query;query=resource.type%3D%22cloud_function%22%20resource.labels.function_name%3D%22siWebFirestoreExport%22%20resource.labels.region%3D%22us-central1%22?project=social-income-prod&authuser=1&hl=en)
which triggers hourly backups of our production firestore database. The
exports are saved to the
[social-income-prod](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/social-income-prod;tab=objects?forceOnBucketsSortingFiltering=false&authuser=1&project=social-income-prod&prefix=&forceOnObjectsSortingFiltering=true)
bucket with a retention period of 30 days. To restore the database you
can
[import](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/import-export?authuser=1&project=social-income-prod)
the most recent folder directly from the
[social-income-prod](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/social-income-prod;tab=objects?forceOnBucketsSortingFiltering=false&authuser=1&project=social-income-prod&prefix=&forceOnObjectsSortingFiltering=true)
bucket.
