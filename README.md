> Social Income is a radically simple solution in the fight against
> poverty. We turn 1% of anyone's salary into an unconditional basic
> income for people living in poverty – sent directly to their mobile
> phones. The tools that make this possible are built and continuously
> improved upon by an open source community, who use technical skills to
> take on the SDG 1 ([No Poverty](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal1)) and
> the SDG 10 ([Reduced Inequality](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal10)).

### Our monorepo contains the following tools used to run Social Income:

- Admin Tool for managing contributors and recipients
  ([README](admin/README.md), `↗`
  [admin.socialincome.org](https://admin.socialincome.org))
- Mobile App for recipients (([README](recipients_app/README.md), `↗`
  Google Play Store link added soon)
- Firebase Functions for scheduled functions, firestore triggers and
  webhooks ([README](functions/README.md))
- User Interface for reusable user interface react components manged
  with storybook ([README](ui/README.md))
- Website for contributors (`↗`
  [socialincome.org](https://socialincome.org)) (to be migrated to the
  public repository)
- Survey tool for impact measurement([README](survey/README.md)))

# Code Contributions

Don't forget: open source isn’t an exclusive club. It’s made by people
just like you. You don’t need to overthink what exactly your first
contribution will be, or how it will look. Thank you:

## Stack

We are using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) as development
platform. We are mainly leveraging the following tools:

- [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) for data
  management
- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) for
  user management
- [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting) to serve
  static content like the admin app
- [Firebase Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions) to
  run backend code in a serverless framework

### Development Setup

For development we use [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and rely on
local
[Firebase Emulators](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite),
which are populated with dummy seed data. Ensures that no one will
require production Firebase credentials to contribute.

To avoid any operating system specific installation, we use a
[helper docker image](Dockerfile) and
[docker-compose](docker-compose.yaml) file to run the npm commands and
to start the emulators.

1. Build helper image locally run: `docker compose build`
2. The [Makefile](Makefile) gives you a good overview of the available
   commands. E.g. `make firebase-serve` starts the firebase emulators on
   [localhost:4000](localhost:4000)
3. Visit the READMEs in the submodules for detailed instructions

### Data Seed

⚠️ Don't include any sensitive data in the seed

An initial set of data is imported into the Firebase emulators during
startup.

Start the firestore emulator and our admin with:

```
make admin-serve
```

You can add, delete or amend data directly in the
[Social Income Admin](http://localhost:3000) or in the
[Firestore Admin Interface](http://localhost:4000/firestore/data).

If you want to commit or keep a local copy of your altered data set, you
can execute in a second shell (while the command above still is running)
the command

```
 make firebase-export
```

### Format Code

We are using [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to format the code

```shell
make format-code
```

### Deployment

Testing and deployment of the services is handled automatically through
the [GitHub actions](.github/workflows).

### Backup

We have a
[function](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/query;query=resource.type%3D%22cloud_function%22%20resource.labels.function_name%3D%22siWebFirestoreExport%22%20resource.labels.region%3D%22us-central1%22?project=social-income-prod&authuser=1&hl=en)
which triggers hourly backups of our production firestore database.

The exports are saved to the
[social-income-prod](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/social-income-prod;tab=objects?forceOnBucketsSortingFiltering=false&authuser=1&project=social-income-prod&prefix=&forceOnObjectsSortingFiltering=true)
bucket with a retention period of 30 days.

To restore the database you can
[import](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/import-export?authuser=1&project=social-income-prod)
the most recent folder directly from the
[social-income-prod](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/social-income-prod;tab=objects?forceOnBucketsSortingFiltering=false&authuser=1&project=social-income-prod&prefix=&forceOnObjectsSortingFiltering=true)
bucket.
