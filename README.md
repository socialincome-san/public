> Social Income is a radically simple solution in the fight against poverty. We turn 1% of anyone's salary into an unconditional basic income for people living in poverty – sent directly to their mobile phones. The tools that make this possible are built and continuously improved upon by an open source community, who use technical skills to take on the SDG 1 ([No Poverty](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal1)) and the SDG 10 ([Reduced Inequality](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal10)).

## Code Contributions

Don't forget: open source isn’t an exclusive club. It’s made by people
just like you. You don’t need to overthink what exactly your first
contribution will be, or how it will look. Just follow the principle:

1. Do something
2. Determine how to do it better
3. Rally others to help
